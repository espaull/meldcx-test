# Elliot Spaull - MeldCX Test

## Running the project

To run the project, please run the command `yarn && yarn start` at the root of the project. It will automatically open a browser where you can then log in.

## Testing the project

To run the tests, please run the command `yarn test` (after having already installed dependencies via the previous command). Apologies for the lack of thorough testing. I unfortunately ended up running out of time.

## Comments

I have quite a few things that I would liked to have improve about my solution which I'd be happy to discuss, such as better testing, improved handling of the orbiting 'devices', better validation on the form, better error handling...
